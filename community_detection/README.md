This is the final group project for course CS431/631 (Data-intensive Distributed Analytics) at University of Waterloo.  
This project is done together by Yuxuan DU and myself.  
To get an overview and briefly go through the code, please see the video via https://youtu.be/z6Z1-6YU_wU.
For more information, please feel free to take a look at the report.  
Since we take the responsibility to implement one specific algorithm per person, the code has not been arranged in an organized way.
I will keep it updated once the combination and rearrangement are done. Thanks!
